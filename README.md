# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This was my first attempt at Kaggle competition 
Datasets include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

Train dataset contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, also reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The test dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.

Using the patterns found in the train data, I predicted whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived or not. I achieved a accuracy of 78% (not so good ) *** Working to increase the accuracy ***
